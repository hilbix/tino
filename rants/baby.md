# Free as a Baby

I always paraphrase my software as

    Free as free beer, free speech and free baby.

Why Baby?  This is due to following observations:

> Following is missing some links.  Sorry, no time.

## I refuse to accept Copyright on babies.

We all probably can agree to this, right?

> In my case above this means, I refuse to accept a Copyright on all software published by me.
> 
> Note that I am German, and in Germany the Copyright is done in two distinct laws.
>
> - One is called "Urheberrecht" and sets the right of the creator.
> - The second is called "Verwertungsrecht" which sets the rights of the publisher.
>
> This distinction allows to properly do things here in Germany, not falling into the traps below.
> But the problem with Copyright is, that it tries to combine both, which keeps it beyond repair.


## DNA is a data storage, just like a harddisk or USB-stick.

- We are able today to store any data in DNA.
- Such as copyrighted software!
- The act in unauthorized copying copyrighted software is illegal.
- So to create such a DNA and (ab)use is illegal.

## But we are able today to create a human baby with changed DNA!

The act in doing so is highly illegal in most countries.

But we can embed any data sequence in living DNA.

## The result, the baby, is still legally human!

> Hopefully everybody can agree to this!

Without any doubt such a baby still has all human rights, of course!
All of them!  Without any difference to anybody else on this planet!

## Each human has the right to copy the own DNA unencumbered.

- This is called "reproduction".  And there is a legal reproduction industry!
- So each such baby has the right to get the own DNA sequenced.
- The DNA, which contains the copyrighted software!
- But the baby **owns all rights on the own DNA**!  (Due to human rights!)
- Hence the baby is **allowed to freely copy and use the copyrighted software**.
- Without any license, witout any restriction, without any doubt!
- The grown up baby even has the right to allow others to use its DNA data, unencumbered!

## Humans must not be treated differently

Others must not be treated differently, neither due to their descent nor ethnic (read: DNA).

- Hence they must not be encumbered by something where such a baby would go unencumbered.
- But they are!  Due to Copyright!
- They are enslaved by all those Copyright which existed before they were born!

## Abolish slavery, abolish Copyright!

- There can only be a Copyright for a properly set short duration after something copyrighted material is made available to others.
- Baby geniusses are able to start to utilize their own DNA after 4-6 years.
- If parental rights on the children's DNA are not restricted, this duration becomes only 9-10 months.
- All longer period of Copyright protection enslaves humankind!

## This all is dictated by physics and logic.

- Either we keep the Copyright as is.
- Or we keep Human Rights.

But we cannot have both!

- It's your choice!

## This can be easily extended to apply to all Copyright.

- Because the baby did not do the copying, there is no way to prove which data was encoded in the DNA.
- As you are not guilty until proven guilty you are not guilty until proven guilty.
- You can only be proven guilty when the legal Copyright owner can prove, that you illegally accessed the copyrighted material.
- But for this the Copyright owner must first make sure your DNA does not contain the copyrighted material.
- It's only ok for the state to use DNA in capital crime, but privatly done software piracy is not a copital crime, it is just civil law!
- But even if this would be made legal, the data embodied into the DNA might be encrypted.
- Hence there is, mathematically speaking, no known existing way for the Copyright owner to neglect the existence of the copyrighted material in the DNA!
- It might be ok for the state to hold somebody liable for not revealing something like a passphrase.
- But this certainly is not the case in lawsuits due to Copyright infringement of some human being!
- Hence there is no way to prove the copyrighted material is not in the DNA.
- And this is true already today!

## Did anybody search public domain DNA data for copyrighted material already?

Because if there is we already have a problem.
