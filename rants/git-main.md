# `main` is something completely different

Why a `git`'s `main` branch is something completely different than a `git`'s `master` branch

I am old.  Apparently too old.  Because I remember.  TAnd what happend in the past.

Younger people apparently do not.  Perhaps for a reason.  And they rename things completely different.

However reasoning with something like Political Correctness still does not help to change things to the better.

Like renaming `master` into `main`.

## What's wrong?

`main` is something completely different than `master`.  You can understand that, if you use the idiom in another context:

Create music.  With music you usually have a `master` tape and perhaps something like a `main` tape.
See the difference?

The `master` is what goes into production, while the `main` usually is something, which perhaps did not make it into the `master`.

You may argue, but this is wrong.  There is a natural hierarchy.  If you replace `master` with `main` for something like political correctness, you therefor fail.
They are not synonyms.  They are mutually distinct.  Something completely different.

Is there a good replacement for `master`?  I think no.  Think about universities.  There you have a `bachelor` and a `master`.

Master means mastered.  If you are master, your studies have ended.  This is something completely different to your main studies!  As these are only a part of your Master then!

So there is a huge difference.  Hence you cannot rename `master` to `main` in `git`.  Because this expresses something completely different.

Read:

You can use `main` for a good reason.  But please abstain from using it for a bad reason like Political Correctness.
As with `main` you do not express the whole story.  This should be kept on the `master` branch.  The one which is sound and stable.

So `main` just is something like a `dev` branch.  Something like the `main` part of a program, not the `auxiliary` part or something, like examples.
However, usually you want to keep `main` and `aux` together in the `master` branch.

I, for my part, usually use `git submodules` for this.  So I do not need something like `main`.  However YMMV because I know that most do not like submodules.
I do not understand why, but I read it everywhere.  Some even use huge unmanagable monorepos out there instead allowing millions of submodules within the same
git repository.  Please do not get me wrong.  I like monorepos if done correctly.  However there is no usable implementation out there.
Most systems, like GitHub, even do not allow `./` submodules, they fail if a repos refers to itself as a submodule.

This is the main tragedy, but not the master tragedy.  Hopefully get the difference now.

But the non-existence of properly done monorepos with `git`, again, is something completely different.
