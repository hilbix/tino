# About: Copyright Less License

Most of my sources etc. are nowadays "licensed" under the terms of the Copyright Less License.

## Motivation

This is a license I made up after realizing, that Public Domain is not free enough,
because Public Domain can be encumbered by a Copyright again.

> If you take something which is PD you need not relicense it under PD.
> You can add your copyright above it and sue others.
> If you just wait long enough, perhaps people start to forget that it once was PD,
> and then you can sue them based on your copyright.
>
> This nearly happens each day thanks to software patents where people
> patent things, which are not new, and pretend that this is derived,
> but different enough to patent the whole thing again.
>
> And the whole then is completely covered by your Copyright, making it difficult
> to understand, what's really new and what not.
> With CLL this cannot happen, as you cannot claim Copyright over the CLLed part.


## The CLL gives more freedom than PD

PD means, things are free as in free beer and free speech.

CLL means, things are free as in free beer, free speech and free baby.

You cannot claim a Copyright on a baby.  Regardless how old it is now.
Copyrighting another human being is slavery.

Same must be true for source code.  Source must have the same rights as living beings.

Why?  Because DNA is just source code, nothing else.
It cannot be, that somebody, in whole or in parts, claims Copyright on my DNA!
There simply is no difference.  My DNA is open source.
And must stay this way.  Effectively, it is CLL!

Note that there are DNA memories today.  You can encode any file into DNA and vice versa.
They are interchangeable.  Hence if we are really want to abolish Slavery,
we must abolish Copyrigt.  There is no alternative.  Sorry.

> Note that this extends to Patents, too.
>
> Simply set:  **Intellectual Property is Slavery in it's worst form!**
> It's even more harmful than ordinary slavery, because this not only covers your body, it also covers your thoughts.

And no Open Source License addresses that.  All this still is envforced by Copyright.

Using Copyright to keep things free is like Fucking for Virginity.  Wrong way, sorry!


## Is the CLL OSI certified.

No.  I really have no idea how to do this.  No money, no time, no idea, no interest, no nothing.

Also, the CLL is no license at all.  It's just a legal term stating, that the code must not be covered by any Copyright,
and thereby making it Public Domain in the most basic Public Domain sense.

Also I do not think that the CLL conforms as OSI license, because it does not restrict you.

So there is nothing which prevents you from violating the OSI principles with CLLed code.
The only thing it restricts you is to add a Copyright on the code,
hence prohibiting others to do what they like to do with the code.


## Is the CLL OSI compatible?

This means, can you mix CLL code with [https://opensource.org/osd](https://opensource.org/osd) compliant licenses?

Of course you can!  Let's go into it:

- 1. Free Redistribution  
  The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale.

> The CLL does not restrict any party
> from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution
> containing programs from several different sources.
>
> The CLL does not require a royalty or other fee for such sale.
>
> Hence the CLL does not restrict the OSI license at all.

- 2. Source Code  
  The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form. Where some form of a product is not distributed with source code, there must be a well-publicized means of obtaining the source code for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost, preferably downloading via the Internet without charge. The source code must be the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program. Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed.

> The CLL - as I use it - accompanies the source code.
> The result of this code is covered by the CLL, too.
>
> It allows distribution in any form.  If the OSI license requires the source code, this is perfectly allowed with CLLed code.
>
> If a license requires free tranfer of the source, or jumping trhough a hoop, or eliminating humanity to gain acces,
> nothing is prohibited by the CLL.  Hence you can add such requirements, no problem.  OSI ones.  Or others.
>
> The source code is the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program.
> This is why I made up the CLL.  However you can require all that.
>
> Please note that you can also require that teh code is not deliberately obfuscated.
> However my code usuallz is heavily obfucated for 99,99999% of the World,
> because they are unable to understand correctly, what I speak out rawly.
> Bit this is neither a code limitation nor my fault.
>
> The CLL allows you to add or remove any restriction on CLLed code.
> Only one single little thing is enforced:
> You must not add a Copyright.
>
> As this is not needed here, this point is covered.

- 3. Derived Works  
  The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.

> The CLL allows modifications and derived works.
> It also mixed cod to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.
>
> It does so even for copyright restricted code, because the CLLed part must not be covered by any Copyright.
> So itself must stay PD.  But it does not restrict the copyrighted part, it can stay copyrighted unharmed.

- 4. Integrity of The Author's Source Code  
  The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the distribution of "patch files" with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time. The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code. The license may require derived works to carry a different name or version number from the original software.

> With the CLL you are free what you do.
>
> You can restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form,
> you can enforce "patch files", or special build rules.
>
> The CLL does not change that.  Except that you will get a hard time to do so for the CLLed part,
> as you cannot enforce that using a Copyright.
>
> If the OSI license explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code,
> the CLL does not harm that.
>
> And you can use any name of the CLLed code.  The same, other, none, all, makes no difference.
> The OSI license can happily change or interfere with anything of that.  As the CLL gives you all this freedom to do so.

- 5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups  
  The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.

> The CLL itself does not discrimnate anybody, except those who does not obay the law.
>
> But I think this is true for any OSI license as well.  Hence as long as there are OSI compliant licenses,
> the CLL falls into the same trap.


- 6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor  
  The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.

> The CLL only restricts those who are working on the field of endeavor in breaking the law.
>
> But I think this is true for any OSI license as well.  Hence as long as there are OSI compliant licenses,
> the CLL falls into the same trap.

- 7. Distribution of License  
  The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.

> In fact the CLL does even apply in case you do not know nor see it.
> The only similar license you have to obey is the licence which allows you to live, called law and human rights.
>
> But I think this is true for any OSI license as well.  Hence as long as there are OSI compliant licenses,
> the CLL falls into the same trap.

- 8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product  
  The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being part of a particular software distribution. If the program is extracted from that distribution and used or distributed within the terms of the program's license, all parties to whom the program is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the original software distribution.

> In fact the CLL is a right attached to the program, and it depends on the program's being part of a particular software distribution
> called DNS which makes up human beings with a brain to follow such licenses. This is the only restriction.
>
> But I think this is true for any OSI license as well.  Hence as long as there are OSI compliant licenses,
> the CLL falls into the same trap.

- 9. License Must Not Restrict Other Software  
  The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open-source software.
  
> The CLL does not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with code which comes with the CLL.
>
> However, except for a little thing, which OSI compliant licenses don't do (changing the Copyright)
> the CLL allows other licenses to restrict the CLLed code which is distributed.
>
> Hence the CLL is compatible to the OSI licenses, and vice versa, as the OSI licenses do not harm the CLL as well.
  
- 10. License Must Be Technology-Neutral  
  No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.
  
> The CLL is a legal statement, and this requires a juridical System.
> This is a very individual technology involved.  In fact it is very obscure technology I do not understand at all.
>
> However I think this is true for any OSI license as well.  Hence as long as there are OSI compliant licenses,
> the CLL falls into the same trap.

TL;DR

If the CLL is violating the OSI way, there cannot be any OSI licenses at all.

But as there are, the CLL must be compatible.


## Is the CLL GPLv* compatible?
