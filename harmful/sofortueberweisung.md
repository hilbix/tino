# sofortüberweisung.de is harmful and should die!

## Sofortüberweisung.de, PLEASE DIE IMMEDIATELY!

Someone is stuck abroad and immediately needs money.

So you go to Western Union and use "sofortüberweisung" to transfer money.
Because they promise, this works within minutes.

Everything goes smooth.  At Western Union.

However AFTERWARDS you will see following situation:

- Money is immediately laundered from your bank account
- Money does not reach the designated recipient in time

WTF happenend?  Well, Western Union tells you:

> "Wir warten auf Geld von Ihrer Bank."

Apparently Sofortüberweisung, despite the name,
does not transfer any money "sofort"!

Hence it does not take Minutes as proposed.
In contrast it can take 5 days or more (it can take
2 bank days, which usually do not include weekends
nor holidays)!

> Why is it here?  Because of following possibility:
>
> The designated recipient is expelled from the Hotel,
> then is robbed as a homeless and starves thirsty and hungry,
> because this schitty sofortueberweisung.de choses
> THE SLOWEST POSSIBLE BANK TRANSFER.

Note:

I will not accept any "we are sorry".
THIS SIMPLY MUST NOT HAPPEN.  EVER.

Either it works.  Or not.
And if not, please go out of business.
DO IT NOW!

Period.
