# Harmful

If you think I misinterpreted something:

- Lets talk!  (My native tongue is German)
- [Signal and Threema are on my homepage](https://valentin.hilbig.de/)
- You can also open an issue at GitHub.
  But .. it may take longer until I notice such.


## WorldCoin is considered harmful

I really do not get it.

They lie.  Direct in front of you.  And?  Anybody notices?

Is it really only me who got this?


### Why they lie

When you open their homepage <https://worldcoin.org/> what are those first words you can read?

![Screenshot of worldcoin.org](img/worldcoin-homepage.png)

"**For every human**"

Right?  Did you notice, that this already is a lie?


### What is a human?

Humans come in many forms and sizes.  Some are tall.  Some are small.

Some are women.  Some are men.  Some are different.

Some have hands.  Some doesn't.  Either due to accidents or birth defects.

And some .. do not have eyeballs.

How do you do a retina scan if there are no eyes?


### Why is this a lie?

I tried to find what WorldCoin says about this.  I really tried hard.
I did not find anything about it.

AFAICS this means, that people who have no eyeballs cannot take part on WorldCoin?

> Compare: "For every humans"

Are people without eyeballs not humans, too?

I confirmly believe so.  So in contrast, I call people inhuman,
if they unnecessarily treat humans with disabilities differently.

I really do not think, that they are just dumb there, not recognizing the fact,
that there are humans out there without eyballs.

> Hence there is really no excuse that they do not even mention humans without eyeballs on their homepage.

The only root cause I can think of is, that they actually know it,
but apparently decided to not care about it at all.

> Is it not long ago, that here in Germany, some idiots (let us call them Nazis)
> decided, that certain people do not belong to what they call humans.
>
> So I get a bit angry, when similar idiots might rise again ..

So they actually lie to you at the very first line they tell you.

## Why is WorldCoin harmful

WorldCoin as a Crypto is certainly not more harmful than other Crypto "currencies".
Another one which tries to succeed with just anoter World Domination Plan.

I do not object to the fact that you try so.  But perhaps I must object to the
plan on, how you try it.

The harm with WorldCoin is done by separating society.

As Worldcoin can solely decide, who may take part in WorldID and who does not!
There is simply no guarantee, that they allow people to equally take part.

WorldCoin says differently, but we already know, they lie!  A bloody lie ..


### Do not trust WorldCoin!

We do not trust in our Government for a good reason.
We, the people, control Government instead.
In a Democracy this is called election.
If politicians fail too bad, we do not re-elect them.

> It is perhaps a bit too simple and often has a quite unsatifying outcome.
> However, as [Winston S Churchill said on 11 November 1947](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill#democracy-except):  
> "Many forms of Government have been tried and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time"

In Germany there is an independent public media to allow us to control Government
(a bit.  It barely works), and in America there is the Second Amandment
(the right to wear weapons to defend against the Government if it ever perverts against its people).

**So shall we trust in WorldCoin that they keep up their promises?**

Google once had the catchphrase:  "Don't be evil."

They decided to drop it.  For a very good reason.  Because if you get too big,
you cannot no more avoid to become evil.  As you become the evil yourself.

That is why we have different states and markets competing against each others.
Because we all are different.

I am German and unable to live the US way of life, or the one of China, or that of Russia.
Hence it is good that I can live in Germany and I am not forced to a sole worldwide Government,
perhaps lead by the US, or China, or Russia.

> Note that I welcome every immigrant to Germany, who is willing to live the German way like I do,
> regardles from place of birth, color or ethnicity.  But this something completely different.

Note that the answer to above question is not "No".  It simply is the wrong question.

The real question is, **how can it be made possible, that we can trust WorldCoin an eternity?**

And the answer to this question is as simle as that:  **We can't.**  As this is an impossibility.


### Why we cannot trust WorldCoin

AFAICS

- WorldCoin has a cherity organization behind them who keeps control of the
  blockchain.
- And they also open sourced their blockchain code.
- Also the Iris scanner could be developed in Germany.

However out of this you cannot create trust.

Here are some examples about trust:

- We can trust in our Government, if we are allowed to control it to the needed extent.  See above.
  - In fact we do not have much of a choice here.
- I do trust in Debian.
  - This is out of several decades of best impression, as Debian seems to be very resilient against being compromized.
  - Also I do know enough about Code, Debian packaging and their security structure to trust them.
  - And if nothing else helps, I could take part on Debian itself.
  - Or fork it myself (example: Devuan)
- I even trust in Microsoft
  - It would be completely illogic, that I run computers with Windows without trusting Microsoft.
  - Because those computers will get in touch with my most valuable data, of course!
  - If I would not trust in Microsoft, I would have to abstain to run Windows.
  - Also I run Windows for over 30 years now, so I think, this must be from a trustworthy company.
- I trust Google, Samsung and the Deutsche Telekom
  - Because I own a Samsung smartphone with Android.
  - It is as simple as that.
  - Why?  Because both, Google and the ISP have more control over the phone than I have!
  - The ISP has full control over the cell processor and the SIM card.
  - And Google has full control over the OS.
  - While Samsung provides all of the firmware code.
  - And as my Smartphone protects my bank account, it would be completely illogic not to trust them to the full extend.
- And I trust my Family
  - of course.  But I am here a bit on the lucky side, perhaps.

Here are some examples of those who I do not trust at all:

- I do not trust my bank.
  - Banks operate under the law and, in Germany, therefor there is a customer protection of 100 000 €.
  - So I do not need to trust them.  Trusting my Country is enough!
- Third party virus scanner companies
  - Why whould I trust those in addition to those I already trust?

> - On Windows I use the one which comes from Microsoft.
> - On Linux, I run ClamAV when needed.
>   (I.E. alongside `rspamd` to protect against incoming evil Mails.)

It is good to trust only in the ones, which you really need to rely on.

For example the ones who are in charge of your life (like Doctors and Flight Captains)
or control all of your data or saftety (Police).
In the best case these are also fully trustworthy, too.

**But in no circumstance, put trust in anybody else.**  Even if the seem to be trustworthy.

This is why I will never need to trust some company like McAfee.

And this then extends to WorldCoin of course.

**It is just stupid to trust WorldCoin,** regardless of who runs it.
And it is especially stupid to trust them,
as they even started lying with just their first words!

### What can you do instead

Of course you can put money into WorldCoin and speculate with it.
Its crypto, so perhaps you are lucky.

But perhaps
[you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CargoLifter)
[are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirecard)
[not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos).

What me bothers most is, that only WorldCoin is in full control.
You, the rightful user, have no other choice than to trust what they tell you.

So if they tell you, that some WorldID is referring to a human and not an AI,
you can you verify this claim yourself?

They give you no way to verify this.

Also how can you be sure, that somebody does only own a single WorldID?

First, a human has 2 eyes.

- Go to a doctor and let your right eye be bandaged.
  - The doctor states, that the bandage must not be removed for medicine reasons.
- Now register a WorldID.
- Go to a doctor, let the bandage be removed and let your left eye be bandaged.
  - The doctor states again, that the bandage must not be removed for medicine reasons.
- Now register a WorldID at another location.

How does this stand the claim, that you can only get a single ID?

> Or do they discriminate against ill people and refuse to register them?

Second, how trustworthy are those Orb operators?

- Find one who can be bribed.
- Then create 100 artificial Iris Scans in the system.
- You have 100 additional IDs then.

Third, who hinders WorldCoin to sell additional WorldIDs to others?

- They tell you they will not do, of course!
- How can you be sure?

Fourth, how does this company ensures data safety?

- Do you get a backup of your record?
- Note that the GDPR says, that they must hand out all of the privacy data they own in a machine readable form!
  - Do they provide that?
- How do they make sure, that these data is kept secret?

Just think about following:  If a Hacker wants to steal data from a company
which keems all data safe in a Cloud, then the Hacker does not attack the company.
It is often more productive, to just to attack on the Cloud level
or do it by social engineering (like becoming an employee).

So are you really sure, that some hacking companies (read: Intelligence Agencies)
do not have their fingers in all those major clouds?

Do you really think that thoese Intelligence Agencies are so inept,
that they do not do this already?

The problem with data is, that you cannot keep it safe for all time.
Hence the best is, not to keep such data at all.

> This is due to our Universe, as the spread of the wave function is unlimited.

I was unable to find out where [WorldCoin](https://worldcoin.org/) or
[their Foundation](https://www.worldcoin.foundation/) is located and runs their secure data services.

Some news says they are located at the Kayman Islands, which would even reduces my level of trust in them.

So they probably do not fall under the [US NSL law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security_letter),
but I am not sure, because that depends which cloud provider they use
(AWS and Azure are both driven by an US based company, and hence fall under the NSL).

> - `worldcoin.org` uses Cloudflare for web, which is an US based company which falls under the NSL.
> - `worldcoin.foundation` uses an US based ISP for web, which might be a CDN, but I am not sure.
>
> But both does not tell me where those "double encrypted database" could be located ..

If they host their services in a data center on the Kaymans, then I am pretty sure,
all major Intelligence Agencies are already on-site and have full access to their data.

Note that it is the job of those Agencies to do that!  And I think, they are usually very good in what they do!


### Also they make unwise, clumsy and false claims

Cites are from their [FAQ](https://worldcoin.org/faqs) seen on 2024-05-02:

> You can easily backup your account by selecting iCloud (iOS) or Google Drive (Android) backup in the wallet on your World App. For a step-by-step guide, click here.

WTF?  Why is iCloud or Google Drive involved?  Such valuable data must certainly better protected
than put in some obscure Cloud service.  (See "Intelligence Agencies" above.)

But perhaps I am wrong and they encrypt the file and I just do not know.
As I refuse to hand out my biometrics to them I cannot install their App and check it out myself.

However leaving people like me in the dark about what they do and how secure they do that,
is very very clumsy.  Because, if done properly, there is absolutely no need to hide the important details!

> "The system has been designed to keep your data secure even in the case your phone gets compromised."

That's plain impossible.  Perhaps they can keep it secure against some certain compromizes,
but - by the impression of the reader - claiming it against all sorts of compromizes is complete bullshit.

Read: Again, they lie to you, and they must know it!

Telling that "it is secure" while they know that there are certain attacks which will comprimize
you data, again is a big fat ugly lie!

> All that remains on Worldcoin’s servers is a persistently encrypted encrypted iris code,
> a mathematical representation of the texture of the iris that is not linked to an individual’s wallet
> or World App account, permanently stored in an encrypted database (two layers of encryption).

WTF?  The number of encryption layers does not matter at all.
There is no much difference between encryption and decryption (like rot-13),
hence doubling the encryption even might be a sign of retardation!

The only important thing is, how encryption is done.  Is it symmetric or asymmetric?
Which algorithm is used?  How is the database encrypted?  What is the goal for the encryption?

If done properly, there is no need for encryption at all.  A hash would be enough,
such that you can even publish the information publicly in the Blockchain and no harm is done by that!

Hence using encryption where it is not needed (no, sorry, double encyption) sounds to me like an excuse.
An excuse for something, I do not understand!  Such unnecessary things are more than just suspicious,
for me it sounds like there must be a big fat bloody lie behind that.  Something they do not tell.

> Worldcoin project contributors have worked via both in-app and in-person attestations to ensure that only individuals 18+ have access to the Worldcoin network.

This apparently

[lie](https://www.heise.de/news/Biometrische-Kryptowaehrung-Spanien-verbietet-Worldcoin-9648615.html)!

Or did they invent this rule in just the last days?  Then I think it is even worse!


# Final words

Everything I tell here is the truth and my real opinion on that.
And I am willing to defend my democratic right to warn others if I think this is needed!

I did my best to avoid errors.  But I am human, so I might err!
Hence, if something is wrong here, this is not my fault,
but only due to the scarce and highly irritating information that WorldCoin provides.

You might argue, that I did no deep research to present all this.  This is true.
But why do they do it so hard to find the right information?  Why is this information
readily available on their homepages?  If they want to play with open cards,
why do they make the information so hard to find?

This reminds me on how professional scammers work.  They provide all information such,
that the important stuff is very well hidden, such that you do not get hold on the full story.

This might trick naiive people.  However it makes me immediately suspicios!
