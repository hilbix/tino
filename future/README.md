# Future

This is about the future.  Here I write things which I think the future will bring.

You can see on the commit, when I had written this.  And then compare, if I am right or not.

> Sorry, many entries will be in German, because this is my native language.

Notes:

- This here is not about what I want.  It is about what I think will come.
- Most time **I do not want to be right**.  Because this means the world took the wrong course.
- We do not live in a Pipi Langstrumpf world ("ich mach' mir die Welt, wie sie mir gef√§llt"), so we will not get, what we want.
- Nevertheless, we are still responsible for this future.  As many parts it is mankind, who's set the course.
