# Google Photos sharing function violates GDPR

This is a big warning to the Internet community.

IN THE EU IT IS PROHIBITED TO USE THE SHARING FUNCTION OF GOOGLE PHOTOS, as this violates the GDPR.

According to the GDPR you are responsible to do documentation about who has access to private data.
You also need to present this information ot all people who might be affected.
You need to present this information to all people PRIOR to using their data.
And you need to DOCUMENT this presentation, such that you can proof this on the court without any doubt.

If you take a picture of somebody, this clearly involves data which identifies the person.
Hence this falls under the GDPR.

There is no problem on the private sector.  Private sector means, you take the photo for yourself.
And/or you share this information privately.

**However Google Photo has no such option to share information privately!**
All sharing in Google Photos is done publicly, as anybody, who gains access to the sharing link has full access to all photos.

As this link is created by Google and not by you, you have no control over this sharing information.
*You cannot keep this secret.*

This would not be a problem if sharing pictures does not include sensible information.
However usually you share sensible information in pictures.  Like the position of the picture, or picturs of children.

In that case **you** must protect this information, and **you** must have established the procedures
which are able to protect the information and **you** must implement a way to secure that these procedures are followed.

This is part of the GDPR.  You cannot escape this.

As **you** are not Google, you **directly violate the GDPR** by using the sharing functions of Google Photos.

There would be no problem if Google Photos would include a way to share Photos in private.
That is, that you were able to restrict access to only those people, who are invited.

With Google Drive you can do this.  With Google Photos you cannot.  This means:

**DO NOT USE THE SHARING FUNCTION OF GOOGLE PHOTOS.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!**

> **Warning!** By default, Google Drive sharing function gives others the right to further share the data.
>
> This option is dangerous, as according to GDPR **you** must be able to tell a court to whome the data was shared.
> Now if you allow others to share things furhter down, they might become a processor, which means, you need a legal
> contract between you and them.  Usually you won't have that, so you violated the GDPR again.
>
> So be sure to not fall into this trap and switch off this option for others to extend the sharing in your name.
