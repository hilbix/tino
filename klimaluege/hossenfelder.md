# Sabine Hossenfelder

Ich liebe diese Frau.  Ernsthaft.
Vor allem wegen ihrer holistischen Herangehensweise.
Und ihrem Humor.


## Angst

Sabine Hossenfelder really makes me nervous.
Because she confirms nearly everything I am talking about.

> Not in detail what I say.  But she confirms, that we should have more Angst in this area.

> And this is my motivation, too.  I do not think that we will all be gonna die soon.
> We do, as we only have some extremly short living period like 100 years or so.
> So nothing to worry about!

> The climatic change is much more dramatic when you stop looking at it
> only for your own life span or the next few generations.

> Hence, what I say in "Klimalüge" is,

> 
> What I do NOT say in "Klimalüge" is, that climatic change is wrong.
> We only err in what we (try to) do about it.  It is the wrong direction, because, for me,
> **it is completely unreasonable to believe, that we can stop climatic change**!
>
> So telling people, that the climatic change is made by us is a lie.
> Because when it is, we should be able to stop it.  We can't.  Its already too late!
> 
> The only thing we CAN do, instead, is to try to not make it even worse.
> That's all.  But, we will not archive even this simple goal!
> We will fail in that.  As we always fail.  As we cannot escape from being human.
> And, this time, it looks like we will fail even the hardest possible way.
> It probably will get even worser, than anybody (including me) is able to think about or predict today.
>
> That's a simple fact out of human history.  There never was any contradiction to this!
> All changes in human history are based on trainload of dead people.
> And this time, we will face it again.  And again.  And again.
>
> Mankind is horrible.  Live with it.
>
> So the only thing we will archive, is **to evade our immediate extinction**.
>
> But if we do not want to face our extinction in the long term, **there is only one single thing
> we can do:  Leave the planet Earth behind.**  There is no other plan possible.  Period.
>
> The sad thing is, that we can archive this now.
> But **if we continue, as we act now, this plan will never come true**.
> This is just more than very likely.  And very frustrating.
>
> This is the Klimalüge.  We plan our extintion.  And we pave the way for this today.
>
> You have been warned.  Please accept the consequences.  If you do, everything is fine.
> 
> So what do you chose?  The same life as today?  Or life of mankind in the future?
> Chose carfully, as you cannot have both.
>
> What I see today is that **currently everyboy choses their life**.
> This is very short sighted as this means, mankind will go extinct.
> Not until 2100.  Probably not until 2525.  Perhaps not even until 10000.
>
> But if we never leave this Planet, we **will go extinct for sure**.
>
> AFAICS we have to act now.  Because there is a high likelihood,
> that we will no more be able to act later.  So now is the time.
> As **time never comes back** this is for sure.

Compare it with some random response:

https://youtu.be/q4EuvpDzlUY?t=600 I cannot agree to him at that point!

- He is comparing the wrong things here.
- He is wrong in that it is "academic".
- Sabine says, that the hot models predict weather forcast better these days.
- He says, these hot models do not predict the weather in the far past.
- Do you see the problem?

> We are not talking about clima in 20000 years or so.
> We are talking about the clima in the next 100 years.

If a climatic model does not fit the situation 20000 years back,
this is far less troublesome than a climatic model, which happens
to fits better to the near future.  As these models then are likely
to continue to predict the future better than the others do.

> Why?  Because the fit better your current situation than the situation a few thousand years back.
> A situation we only estimate and which does not have good data at all!

https://youtu.be/q4EuvpDzlUY?t=725 Again, I cannot agree to him at that point.

- He says, that there are so many possible studies.
- But Sabine already clearly stated, that she does not know whome to trust.
- So this is the wrong argument here.
- What Sabine says is, that the evidence is more alarming than people usually agree to.
- **And he is exactly proving her point!**

https://youtu.be/q4EuvpDzlUY?t=1015 And finally, I still cannot agree to him.

- You again completely miss the point here.
- It does not have anything to do with her attitude to climate change.
- It does not have anything to do with the climate sensitivity at all.
- It has to do on how people do their scientific work.
- You might get this impression.  Anybody might get it.
- But this is only because people are stupid.

> Do not try to explain things to stupid people.
> They will never be able to understand it correctly.

It is correct to point out, that people might understand it wrong.
But please, then explain to them why they are wrong and how it should be interpreted correctly.

But please do not tell her wrong just because you did not understand her motivation.
