# Klimal√ºge (climatic lie)

## We are near the end of the current ice-age

This is not a question.  This is not even something we can discuss.  This is just the plain truth:

We are still in the possible (and then probably normal) range of climatic changes at the end of an ice age.

## What does this mean

Well, the end of the previous ice age was a bit more than 120 thousand years ago.
Then our current ice age started and arround 20000 years ago the current warm period began.
And it can very well be that we are probably just at the end of it.

Just have a look at the graphs:

![Ice Age cycles](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Milankovic-Zyklen_2017_%28cropped%29.jpg/1456px-Milankovic-Zyklen_2017_%28cropped%29.jpg)

I am not a scientist in this area, but for me everything looks pretty normal.

AFAICS we do not have good data of the last warming period.  We have data.  But I doubt we have similar
observations as we have today.  So - for me - it is very likely that we just cannot compare our current
situation on earth to the situation 130000 years ago.

Hence we simply do not know if it is normal what is going on today or not.

But if it happens to be normal, then human made climatic change is just a lie.
And even if this cycle is not normal, does this rule out other similar abnormal cycles than the one we are currently in.

So the question is:

- Do we live in a normal cycle?
- Or is this cycle something very special?
- And if it is very special, can we rule out that this is just by chance?

If we cant, everything we talk about is just a lie.  Either we have scientific facts, or we just speculate.


## What does this mean

I tried to verify this.  To find information about this subject.  To find out, that our cycle is abnormal.
And that this abnormality can be ruled out to be in the range of what nature gives without humans interfering.

But I failed.  Why is this information so hard to find - if there is any at all?

I want to see very prominent information about this matter.  Something which I can verify.
Something which does not only talk about the last couple of hundred years,
but takes a closer look for [at least 2,7 million years](https://wiki.bildungsserver.de/klimawandel/index.php/Beginn_des_Eiszeitalters).

With references and everything.  Such that there simply are no more questions.

But there are open questions.  A lot of.  Perhaps more questions than we probably have time left to answer!


## What does this mean

This means, that we probably just do not know anything.  That trying to stop the cimatic change might be
even less likely to succeed than Don Quixote against the giants (windmills).  Or not.

But I still thing, that everything we do to save the clima is doomed and we cannot
change anything or at least fail at it miserably.

Or said differently:  I would wish we are right and there is an extreme anthropogene climatic change,
as this would tell us, that we can do something against the cooling wich certainly is ahead of us.
That we can stop the next ice age from coming up.

But AFAICS mankind is incapable to do all this.  We will fail as we always do.


## What does this mean

This means, that we must intensify our struggle to become resilient against the climatic changes.
Regardless in which direction things head.

> As this is where mankind is good at:  Adopt to the situation.  And we do it by failing until we just survive.

Everything we do should work if it becomes warmer, and also if it becomes cooler.

For example things like vertical farming:

- This is indoors.
- So we do not need the outside to have good temperatures.
- There could be ice outside.  Or desert heat.  Both works.

For example renewable energy:

- If the temperature goes up a lot, we cannot expect to get energy from other countries.
  - Hence we need something like solar power and wind to give us the energy we need.
- But if the temperature drops below 0 and the albedo of the earth goes up (read: no sun due to clouds)
  we still need to be able to create the energy.
  - Well, in that case we possibly can use fossile fuels, but those will not last the next 100000 years, hence they are not a good deal.
  - Perhaps Wind will still be plenty
  - Or we just dig down and take the heat of the planet's core.

And so on.  So many things we do currently is the right thing to do.

But there are certainly utterly wrong things we currently do, too:

- Burning wood is certainly wrong in all the possible scenarios.
  - Wood is considered to be renewable.  But this is pain wrong.
  - If temperature goes up, the regrowth of forests will not happen.
  - If temperature goes down, the regrowth of forests will not happen.
  - Only existing forests have a very small chance to survive.
  - But we kill them all.  Today.  By burning them and just hope to regrow them.
- Use Atomic Power Plants
  - At least the ones we build today which need cooling are doomed.
  - We cannot cool things, if there is no more water due to a drought
  - We cannot cool things, if there is no more water because it has turned to ice
  - Hence either way, it is just the wrong thing to do to create such big power plants which are difficult to cool.
  - Also Atomic Power Plants poollute the environment too long after they go out of business.
  - As there is no such thing like a good nuclear waste.  There probably is nothing more toxic than nuclear waste!

Do not get me wrong:

We need Atomic Reactors.  We need them to burn all the atomic waste we have created and will create
(for example from hospitals and research).
Dumping the atomic waste somewhere for million of years will not work in the long term.
It will go wrong.  Hence the best thing is to create an economic ressource out of atomic waste.

This, however, means not to create electricity or district heating with them.
This type of reactor will not run steadily.  It is not there to produce energy,
it is primarily there to get rid of nuclear waste.  But it creates heat and energy, though,
which we can utilize for something good.  Like producing hydrogen with it.

> I think, this way we can perhaps create around 1% of the hydrogen we need on this planet.
> This is not enough, of course.  Hence it is not a solution to the hydrogen problem.
> But it is a way to implement this economically, because it produces some scarce ressource
> which can be sold and hence cheapens the process in getting rid of nuclear waste.


## What does this mean

This means:

Stop lying and think again.  And then just do the right thing.  But do it!  And start yesterday doing so!

Because time is up already.
