# NodeJS Addon from Scratch

## What is the problem?

I hate NPM because it is a security nightmare.  Extremely bloated, with an absolutely insecure registry behind and error prone like hell.

Just a little typo and you have your successful intruder thanks to a supply chain attack.  Sorry, this disqualifies NPM.

So all recipes using `npm` fail, because they enforce access to the NPM registry.

They will never get this.  Period.
