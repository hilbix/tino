# HowTo MineCraft

Here I document, how I run a customized vanilla Minecraft Server

> This is probably VERY incomplete

## Vanilla

Vanilla means, this is the original Mojang code.  No changes.  No Forge.  No Bukkit.  Nothing.
Just plain original.

However it still is highly customized for my needs.

## Why?

I tried many things.  Bukkit.  Forge.  Whatever.

However I do not have much time to spare.  So I want someting which just works.
Which I understand.  And which is mostly hassle-free.

As we now can do many (if not all) things with datapacks, this is enough for me.

**This has the advantage, that I do not need a customized MineCraft Client, too.
Everything runs with the standard install!**
