# IntelliJ IDEA

Very well hidden things in IntelliJ Idea

## Disable Task Management Plugin

> I do not have any idea what it is meant to do for me.  I found no Documentation which enlightens me.

- Menu "File"
- Entry "Settings"
- Select "Plugins"
- Select "Installed"
- Search for "Task"
- Select "Task Management"
- Select "Plugin Settings..."
  - Hides as a Gear-Button on the right.
  - It is not the other Gear-Button on the top.
- Select Disable
- Click "Apply"
- Restart "IntelliJ Idea"

## Keep Bookmarks when switching Branches

> !BEWARE!
>
> Switching Workspace with Branches not only switches the bookmarks,
> it also switches which files are open etc.
>
> So depending on your workflow you want this setting to stay enabled (which seems to be the default)

- Menu "File"
- Entry "Settings"
- Expand "Version Control"
- Select "Confirmation"
