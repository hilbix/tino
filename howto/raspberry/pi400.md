# Raspberry PI 400

This is the PI4 with 4 GB RAM which comes with keyboard.


## Important

**Do not use `rpi-update`** except if there is no other way to do it.  
It might install Kernel and Drivers from the unstable tree.


## Config

```
sudo raspi-config
```

T.B.D. what to do here to get a stable system

T.B.D. what to do here to deeper configure the PI

`/boot/config.txt`


## WiFi

I have problems getting the PI 400 WiFi running the stable way as access point.
So I am still looking for how to do it properly.

> I use SystemD for DHCP, routing etc.

Here is what I found:

```
apt update
apt full-upgrade
apt install hostapd
apt mask dhcpcd
```

`/etc/hostapd/ap0.conf`
```
interface=ap0
driver=nl80211
country_code=DE
hw_mode=g

channel=1
ssid=YOURSSID
wpa_passphrase=YOURPASSPHRASE

wmm_enabled=0
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0

wpa=2
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
rsn_pairwise=CCMP
```

`/etc/systemd/network/20-ap0.network`
```
[Match]
Name=ap0

[Network]
Description=PI
Address=192.168.XXX.254/24
DHCPServer=yes

IPMasquerade=yes
IPForward=yes

LinkLocalAddressing=no
```

```
systemctl daemon-reload
networkctl reload
systemctl unmask hostapd
systemctl restart hostapd
```


### following did not work

These were found in Internet but did not work at my side.

> But perhaps might be helpful for other configurations.

Following package does not exist

    apt install firmware-bcrm80211


## vLAN

The RPI only has one network interface.  This is a bit few for a router.

But you can use vLANs plus some vLAN capable switch to extend the number of interfaces.

> The total bandwidth then is shared, of course.  
> In this setup I regularily can archive routed traffic troughput of around 10 MB/s and a Gigabit vLAN switch.

### Lan 1 example: IPv6

- Own IP at .1
- Router at .254 
- `XXX` stands for your IPv4 subnet IP (uplink NAT)
- IPv6 is delegated (uplink no-NAT)
- You can change the `Description` of course

`20-lan1-XXX.1.network`
```

### Lan 2 example: IPv4 only

- Own IP at .1
- Router at .254 
- `XXX` stands for your IPv4 subnet IP (uplink NAT)
- IPv6 is not configured
- You can change the `Description` of course

`/etc/systemd/network/20-lan2-XXX.1.network`

```


### Lan 3 example: not routed

- Own IP at .1
- No router
- `XXX` stands for your IPv4 subnet IP (uplink NAT)
- IPv6 is not configured
- You can change the `Description` of course

`/etc/systemd/network/20-lan3-0.0.network`

Here I list things I found but do not remember anymore:

```
