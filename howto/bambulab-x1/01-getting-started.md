# The good

The BambuLab X1 Carbon Conbo ships in a very well designed compact state.  
So the designers of the BambuLab seem to know how to do it.  At least physically.

The main problem, however, is the documentation.  
The "getting started" booklet which comes with the printer is .. not exactly wrong but .. a bit misleading.

And important steps are missing.  There is some updated version in the internet, but this still is not completely satsifying.

For example:

- How to remove all the protective foils?  Some are stuck very tightly.
- What are the right tools to use to unlock the screws?
- What to do in which order?

And so on.  So before you do anything, **use your brain**.  Some things cannot be done as advertized.


## Bringing it into operational state took 4 hours

They say: 15 minutes from delivery to first print.  Wrong.  It took me alone 2 hours to:

- Move the printer near the place where it should run
  - It is very heavy
  - And I am an old thug, but it too quite some time to lift it there
  - **BEWARE THE HANDLES**.  Use protective cloves, as the handles in the transport packing will cut your fingers.  **YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!**
- Pull the printer out of the packing
  - It is very heavy
  - So put it down on the floor
  - Put the package upright
  - Open the packaging on the top.  Only on the top!
  - Lift the printer from there onto the table
  - For this use the two edges which are fastend with duckt tape
  - The sign on the packing is not very clear
  - Over all:  It is good design.  But badly documented.  See?
- Pull out the rest from the packing
  - Documentation says you get 4 Filament Spools
  - I only got 3
- Read and try to understand the getting started booklet
  - This is English only.  No problem for me but might be a problem if you do not understand English properly.
- Pull out the accessories first before the AMS
  - The parts are taped within the packaging, so difficult to get out
  - Be careful to get them out of the package (I dropped a piece on the floor and it nearly made it into a neraby gully.) 
- Untighten all the screws
  - You need the round edge (on the longer leg) of the Allen Key H2
  - However **to untighten the screw of the spool holder** on the back you need to use the small leg of H2**!
  - (I almost destroyed the round edge because I used the wrong side)
- Be sure to remove all the foam and foils before the first power on
  - Except the foam below the printing bed, this can only be removed after the printer has finished it's first calibration!
- Install the AMS properly
  - **Important:** Check that the [filament buffer spring](https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/x1/troubleshooting/ams_buffer_signal_lost#h-2-check-the-buffer-spring-and-slider) is seated correctly!
  - (It was ok my side, but you get in trouble if it isn't.)
- Initialize the printer properly after the first power on
  - This included to bring it into the network
  - This included a software update of the printer
  - This included installing the Android App "Android Handy"
  - This included an additional firmware update of the printer via the App 
  - This part alone took nearly 1h
- Find out how to load the filament in the AMS
  - Loading only works after the printer is powered on after it is initialized
  - You have to push the handle with a decent force to load it
  - Put the PLA on the left!
  - I started at the right, so the left position was empty.

Then I tried to download and understand the manuals.  No success.
So I had to google for it and found some hints on the Bambu Wiki and Reddit.

This took the other 2 hours until I was confident enough to start my first print of an internal model ..

.. and this does not include the time to get started with Bambu Studio on Windows 11, of course.
