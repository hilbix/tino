I am a bloody layman when it comes to 3D printing.  
All I know is how to do Computer (like Administration and Programming), Network (like Internet) and Unix (like Linux).

This here is, where I combine all the bits an pieces I had to put together to get started with the BambuLab X1 Carbon Combo.


# WTF?

I bought the BambuLab X1 Carbon Combo which is extremely expensive compared to other 3D printers.

Why?

Because I am interested in 3D printing.  **But I am far from being anything like an an enthusiast.**

I just want to do 3D prints like I do paper prints.  Add the consumables and go.

Exactly the same is what I want to do with 3D printing:

- Add the filaments
- And print

Nothing to think or worry about.  Just print.

But ..

.. **we are still not there**.

It may be that the Bambulab X1 Carbon Combo is a leap forward, **but you must still become an expert in how to use it properly**.

This is not the problem.

## The problem is lack of documentation

It may be that the printer is better than other printers in things like:

- bed levelling
- cleaning the nozzle
- changing the filament
- preventing spaghetti

and so on, but you definitivley need to know not only your printer but also a lot about 3D printing.  
So the BambuLab X1 still is nothing for people who do not want to dig deeper into 3D printing but rather just print 3D models.

For people like me the current documentation very scarce.

- The printer is poorely documented.
  - For example the power button and emergency stop button on the printer are not even mentioned in the manual.
- BambuLab is even not providing legally required documents.
  - I noted that they lack the (in Germany required) proper "Widerrufsbelehrung", but no response yet.


## Reddit to the rescue

The only way currently to use the printer is to search with Google which mostly hits Reddit.

Looking through 100 or more pages to find just a single bit of information.

And you need trainloads of such bits.  Just to get started.
