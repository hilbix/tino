# ns1

Updated ns1

- root now is on LVM, too
- LVM is mirrored
- Updated to latest kernel
- Configuration cleaned up
- Preparation tasks to upgrade to Debian Buster:  
  Bootstrap a `fallback` Linux which can be booted in case the main Linux gets defunct in the upgrade process.

The machine has 3 disks, 2 of them are on the same controller and share the same IRQ,
exposing lost IRQ problems when used at once.

Hence only 2 of the disks are usable for mirroring currently.
Not a big problem, though, it's just a nameserver.

TODOs:

- Be able to boot into the `fallback` Linux
- Do LVM snapshot
- Upgrade to buster
