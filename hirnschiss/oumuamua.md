# Oumuamua, an Alien Probe?

> https://www.zeit.de/wissen/2018-11/oumuamua-alien-extraterrestrial-life-harvard-comet-abraham-loeb-english

No!  There is absolutely no evidence for this.  There are some anomalies around Oumuamua, which can have many explanations.

And yes, Oumuamua being an Alien Probe is certainly one of them.
However if you believe in that, you can likewise believe in that Oumuamua is God,
or the only sentient being in the Universe which only dreams of us Humans.
You get it, people who believe in that, with the current data about Oumuamua, are plain stupid.
And they belong to the most stupid people on this planet, too.
And commonly you refer to those as being idiots.

Here is proof why.

What is Stupidity?
[Stupidity is a lack of intelligence, understanding, reason, wit, or common sense.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupidity)
Says Wikipedia.  Well, this definition is a bit stupid itself, but we can take it as some definiton.

Now back to Oumuamua and the article found in zeit.de.

> Oumuamua is really weird.

Nope.  It's most likely an interstellar object.  We havn't met many of them yet.
Hence we cannot even be sure about the typical nature of interstellar objects.
Something which we do not know is not weird.  It is just unknown.
This does not exclude, that it is weird.  But there is no data at all that it is weird.

So there is no evidence, that this saying is true or false.  But there is a high likelyhood that it is false.

What certainly is true, that Oumuamua is quite interesting.
This includes the data, which seems to be weird to very naive obervers.
For real scientists, the data might be puzzling, but there is no proof, that it is weird.  Yet.

So if you say, it is weird, you state, that you are not intelligent enough to understand, how science works.
That's double stupid.  First you call yourself stupid.  And second it is stupid to call yourself stupid.

> Some people would say it’s an outlier.

There is few data about small interstellar objects yet.
If you say it is an interstellar object (which is true for an alien probe which is from outside the solar system),
then you simply have not enough data to think about it as some outlier.
Intelligent people immediately understand that.

> But it certainly doesn’t look like asteroids or comets we find in our Solar System.

Year, well, duh, because, perhaps, it is, by chance, some interstellar object?  Could it be?

> It has an extreme shape.

Nope.  We do not know that.  There is no data about the shape.  All we have are some blinkenlights from it.
There is no picture.  Telling you, it has an extreme shape, is like telling you, that a person must be fat,
from a steroscopic video, which has the dimensions 2x2.  You simply cannot tell how Oumuamua looks.

> Based on the reflected sunlight, it appears to be much longer than it is wide by a factor of five to 10.

He is talking of 2 dimensons of a 3 dimensional shape.
It also can be a perfect sphere which has parts of an higher albedo.
Or we were very unlucky taking the samples.
Or it is broken into two or more pieces.
It just can be some optical illusion.

Unfortunately we are not able to see it good enough or take more photos to test some theories.  It is too far away now.

> And it’s being pushed by a force additional to the gravity of the sun,
> so something is affecting it, as another recent paper by another research team states.

OMFG.

Just because it is not at the position where we think it is, it is propelled?
And because it is propelled, it must be some Sun Sail?

No.  There are trainloads of other possibilities, why it is as it is.

Starting with "somebody got the data wrong" (as we are not able to verify everything)
up to "there is some effect we do not know" (on interstellar objects)
to "our speculation about shape and density of the object are wrong".

> [..]
> What could be pushing it? The only idea that came to mind was the sunlight.

Nope.  He cited some other paper.  This paper cites several ideas and rules them out afterwards.
Hence there are several possibilities, which are known to show this effect.

Ironically they ruled out the lightsail, too.

What a trainload of bullshit.
No, really, yes, it could be some lightsail enabled probe from some other civilization which sent it to earth on purpose.
Yea, and you certainly can win in lottery even if you never bought a ticket, because you got it from Santa Claus.

This all belongs to pure belief, not science.

Science is the cited paper.  And the first option it ruled out was a push due to solar radiation.
Read:  No lightsail, sorry!


## Let's think about it

### A lightsail?

Constructed some billion years back and then sent to earth.  It survived the long yourney.
It survived crushing in all those debris which surrounds our solar system.
It still is operable today and propells Oumuamua right away from Earth.

But wait!  That's highly intelligent!
Poor Aliens must detect that Earth already is infected by humans all over.
So they send all men in the shrouts, to get away from there, as quickly as possible.

No.  That's perhap a nice Science Fiction.  But Fiction, not Science.

### A civilization?

This, again, is a double fail.

Lightsails might be build by some civilization.  Right.
But why do you need a civilization to build a lightsail?

Also, if it is a civilization, why did they send a probe but do not make contact then?
A civilization capable to create such a probe, which still is capable to sail by the Sun,
must have thought about exactly the situation we see today.

They don't.  Fail.  If it was a civilization, they must be more stupid than we are today.
Have we sent such a probe?  Well, yes, Voyager ;)

But still no lightsails.  Sorry.


### Sent on purpose?

Do you know the film [The Gods must be crazy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080801/)?
Where someone drops an empty bottle of Coca Cola and a bushman takes this as a sign of Gods?

Exactly.  Perhaps it was built on purpose.  But then it was not sent to earth on purpose.

If it is some Alien Probe, it is merely some Debris left of it.
If you think of the size of the Universe,
the time which must have gone by,
and that everything is dead on the probe except the lightsail,
this are just too much "if"s.
Hence it is far more likely that this simply is false.

Hence:  No mission, no purpose.

## Back to the text

> Zeit: So you are saying it’s a possibility. One of many.
> Loeb: Not of many.

Yesssss.  Because there are only a two handful of explanations, it must be the one,
which is far inferior and far more unlikely than everything else.

Well, here is something similar unlikely as an Alien Probe:
Some pixel error in our Holographic Universe.
Perhaps a Hyperbaby dropped her marble (=our Universe) and made a scratch on it's surface.
(Do you know something about the Holographic Universe?
Well, it tells us, that 3 dimensions are enough, we do not need 4 to explain time.
Did you understand what this means?  No?  Sorry, that's to complex to explain quickly.)

## And so on.

You contradict yourself.  You try the truth by telling some complete bullshit.
And you do not try to create interest by using a highly emotional subject.

Either you are a lier, or you are stupid.  Or both.

But wait!  Being a scientist and being caught lying, isn't this stupid, too?

You bet it is!  And that's the proof:  Stupididy, as I told above.

q.e.d.

PS: The only question left is, how stupid it is to react to such a Stupidity.
Well, I leave this excercise to the reader!  
You are welcome!

# DISCLAIMER

Alles, was ich hier schreibe, ist meine absolut wahre Meinung.
Ja, wirklich.

Es ist offensichtlich, wie bescheuert diese Idee ist, dass Oumuamua eine Aliensonde sein könnte.
Schon alleine wegen Occams Rasiermesser fällt diese These durch.
Und es macht mich verdammt wütend, wenn ein Astronom plötzlich solch einen absoluten Blödsinn verbreitet.
Auch wenn er es vielleicht tatsächlich mit einer guten Absicht tun wollte, was ich allerdings stark bezweifle.

Vielleicht steckt etwas ganz anderes dahinter.  Dann war ich zu blöd, es zu begreifen.

IMHO hat Dummheit ganz offensichtlich wenig mit Intelligenz zu tun.
Man kann also gleichzeitig hochintelligent und brunzdumm sein.

Das ist eben der Kritikpunkt bei der Definition der Wikipedia,
Dummheit hätte mit wenig Intelligenz zu tun ;)

Stimmt nicht so ganz.  Wie so vieles.  Z. B. Oumuamua, aber hey, ich drehe mich im Kreis.  Wie dumm di dumm di dumm.
