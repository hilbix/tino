# The Loki Factor

What is the Loki Factor?

The Loki Factor is a simple calculation on how famous a name is.

Here are some Loki Factors:

- 0.01 you might be famous in a certain way
- 0.1 you are regionally famous
- 1 you are famous
- 10 you are very famous
- 20 you are Donald Trump

How is it calculated?  Very easy:

- Enter the name into Google, without quotes.
- Write down the number of Name-Hits.
- Enter "loki marvel" into Google, without quotes.
- Write down the number of Loki-Hits.

The Loki Factor then is just the division of those two:

                         GOOGLEHITS(Name)
    LokiFactor(Name) = ---------------------------
                         GOOGLEHITS(Loki Marvel)

This is easy and convenient.
