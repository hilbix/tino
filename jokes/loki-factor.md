# The Loki Factor

What is the Loki Factor?

The Loki Factor is a simple calculation on how famous a name is.

Here are some Loki Factors:

- 1% you start to become famous in a certain way
- 10% you are regionally famous
- 100% you are famous
- 1000% you are Donald Trump

How is it calculated?  Very easy:

- Enter the name into Google, without quotes.
- Write down the number of Name-Hits.
- Enter "loki" into Google, without quotes.
- Write down the number of Loki-Hits.

The Loki Factor then is just the division of those two:

                         GOOGLEHITS(Name)
    LokiFactor(Name) = -------------------- * 100%
                         GOOGLEHITS(Loki)

This is easy and convenient.

No, sorry, I did not make this up!
Really!

PS: The anomaly "Doctor Who" vs. "Doctor" has to do something with time travel, I think.  I first asked for "Doctor", then for "Doctor Who".  Go figure ;)
